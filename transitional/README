Important information for stable kernels >= 2.6.24.1
====================================================

Starting with kernel 2.6.24.1, sidux kernels and dfsg-free external modules
are available via apt.

The actual packaging is still a work in progress, but the recent local root
exploit *) requires immediate action to provide secure kernel packages. 
While the binary packages for linux-image and linux-headers are already in 
good shape - and safe/ recommended for updating, the source packaging 
still has be considered a work in progress, with adaptions to the support 
infrastructure (like convenience module metapackages) still missing.

*) CVE-2008-08, CVE-2008-09, CVE-2008-10

The preferred way to install the new kernel packages and to stay up to date
is by using the newly added metapackages for linux-image and linux-headers:
amd64:
	apt-get install	linux-image-2.6-sidux-amd64 \
			linux-headers-2.6-sidux-amd64
	
i386:
	apt-get install	linux-image-2.6-sidux-686 \
			linux-headers-2.6-sidux-686

(metapackages for the external modules will follow in a few days)



For kernel 2.6.24.1 (which includes the important security fix for  this means:
	apt-get install	linux-image-%KERNEL_VERSION% \
			linux-headers-%KERNEL_VERSION%

Available module packages via apt:
%EXTERNAL_MODULES%

For transitional purposes, a dummy "kernel-${VER}.zip" providing an adapted
"install-kernel-sidux.sh" to pull the updated kernel and module packages 
is available, at the usual location to allow a seamless upgrade path.
Manual installation using apt are preferred over using "kernel-${VER}.zip" 
are preferred at this stage.
