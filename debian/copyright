  Clarification:
  The GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL is written for
  software libraries in the first place. We expressly want the LGPL to
  be valid for this artwork library too.
  .
  KDE Oxygen theme icons is a special kind of software library, it is an
  artwork library, it's elements can be used in a Graphical User Interface, or
  GUI.
  .
  Source code, for this library means:
   - where they exist, SVG;
   - otherwise, if applicable, the multi-layered formats xcf or psd, or
  otherwise png.
  .
  The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry
  notices. With images this is in some cases impossible or hardly useful.
  .
  With this library a notice is placed at a prominent place in the directory
  containing the elements. You may follow this practice.
  .
  The exception in section 6 of the GNU Lesser General Public License covers
  the use of elements of this art library in a GUI.
